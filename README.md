# Machine-Learning-Incremental-Capstone
Building upon the previous capstone work, which focused on data aggregation, cleaning, processing, and visualization, this phase aims to develop machine learning models to predict hourly bike rental counts. The project will cover feature engineering, scaling, and regression modeling techniques to build an effective predictive model.
